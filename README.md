# EcosystemSimulationGame
The EcosystemSimulationGame is a RPG that simulates aspects of a real-world ecosystem with randomly generated events, loosely based off of Conway's Game of Life. The user plays as a wolf, and must acquire its prey and avoid natural disasters and obstacles. The prey and disasters are randomly generated and move in a similar fashion to cells in Conway's Game of Life.
